In this project you can see how different algorithms
solve the 3 Dimensional Knapsack Problem, the algorithms that you can find in the code are 
the Greedy Algorithm, the Genetic Algorithm and the Algorithm X with Dancing Links.

The problem can be solved in two forms, with parcels and with pentominoes. For choosing
between these items, you have to open the Main folder and go to the RUN_THIS file,
then, you have to run this. After this a window will be open in your screen, you have to choose 
if you want to solve the problem with pentominoes or items. After that will appear an emerging 
window that asks with algorithm do you want to use, you will have to select the Greedy Algorithm
or the Algorithm X with Dancing Links. For the ending in another window will appear the solution 
that the selected algorithm has reached in an interective graphical user interface.

For running the Genetic Algorithm you should go to the GeneticAlgorithm folder and open one of 
this two files, GeneticMainforABC or GeneticMainforLPT. Once you are in one of those folders 
you should run them. It will take some time till the process is finished, you can see on the terminal
the score of each individual, when all the individuals of one generation are printed, the next generation
will be printed.
