# Pentominoes Project

**Project Title:** Pentominoes  
**Purpose of Project:** Solving NP-Hardness problem  
**Version or Date:** 7/10/2021  
**Author:** Gabrijel Radovcic  

## Overview

Welcome to the Pentominoes project! This project explores various algorithms to solve the 3 Dimensional Knapsack Problem, a challenging NP-Hardness problem. The implemented algorithms include the Greedy Algorithm, the Genetic Algorithm, and the Algorithm X with Dancing Links. Additionally, there is a bot designed to play Pentris using both the Genetic Algorithm and the Greedy Algorithm.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Choose the Problem Type:**
   - Navigate to the Main folder.
   - Run the `RUN_THIS` file.
   - A window will appear, allowing you to choose between solving the problem with pentominoes or items.

2. **Select an Algorithm:**
   - After choosing the problem type, an emerging window will prompt you to select an algorithm.
   - Choose between the Greedy Algorithm or the Algorithm X with Dancing Links.

3. **View the Solution:**
   - Once the algorithm completes its process, a graphical user interface will display the solution achieved by the selected algorithm.

## Genetic Algorithm

If you wish to run the Genetic Algorithm, follow these additional steps:

1. **Navigate to the Genetic Algorithm Folder:**
   - Go to the GeneticAlgorithm folder.

2. **Select the Configuration:**
   - Open either `GeneticMainforABC` or `GeneticMainforLPT` files based on your preference.

3. **Run the Genetic Algorithm:**
   - Execute the selected file.
   - Monitor the terminal to view the score of each individual in the generation.
   - The next generation will be printed after all individuals of the current generation are displayed.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different algorithms to solve the challenging 3 Dimensional Knapsack Problem. Enjoy coding and happy problem-solving!
